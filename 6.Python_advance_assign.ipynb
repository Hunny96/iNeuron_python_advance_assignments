    "Exception processing, also known as error handling, is a crucial concept in programming that allows developers to deal with unexpected or exceptional situations in a controlled manner. Here are three applications for exception processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Validation and Error Recovery:\n",
    "When dealing with user inputs or external data, there is a possibility of receiving invalid, unexpected, or inconsistent data. Using exception handling, you can validate the input and raise appropriate exceptions when the data does not meet the required criteria. This helps prevent your program from proceeding with incorrect data and allows you to handle errors gracefully. By catching specific exceptions, you can provide meaningful error messages to users and prompt them to enter valid data or recover from errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "File and Resource Management:\n",
    "While working with files, databases, network connections, or other external resources, exceptions can occur due to various reasons like file not found, network disconnection, or insufficient permissions. Using exception handling, you can handle such situations, close open files or resources properly (even in case of exceptions), and release acquired resources to avoid resource leaks. This ensures efficient resource management and prevents the program from crashing due to unforeseen issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application Fault Tolerance:\n",
    "In large-scale applications, it's important to ensure fault tolerance and maintain the stability of the system. Exception handling can be used to catch unexpected errors and failures, preventing the entire application from crashing. By catching and logging exceptions at appropriate points in the code, you can identify issues, notify administrators, and gracefully degrade or recover from errors, ensuring that the application continues to function as expected under various scenarios."

    "If you don't do anything extra to treat an exception, and the exception is not caught or handled in the code, the program will terminate abruptly when the exception occurs. This is known as an \"unhandled exception.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When an unhandled exception occurs, Python will print an error message, called a traceback, which includes information about the exception type, the line of code where the exception occurred, and the call stack leading up to the exception. After printing the traceback, the program execution will stop immediately."

    "To recover from an exception in your script, you have the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using try and except blocks: Surround the potentially problematic code with a try block, and catch the specific exception(s) using except blocks. This allows you to handle the exceptional situation gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using multiple except blocks: You can have multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions separately, providing customized recovery actions for each scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the else block: Optionally, include an else block that runs when no exceptions occur, allowing you to execute additional code only in the absence of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the finally block: Optionally, include a finally block, which runs regardless of whether an exception occurred. It is typically used for cleanup or resource release tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these options, you can implement robust error handling, provide informative feedback to users, and ensure your script continues to execute smoothly in the presence of exceptions."

    "\n",
    "Using built-in functions that raise exceptions:\n",
    "Python includes several built-in functions that can raise exceptions under specific conditions. For instance, the int() function raises a ValueError when it fails to convert a string to an integer.\n",
